You need to copy or link the usbdrv directory from V-USB package here.
V-USB can be downloaded from http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/.
Tested to work with vusb-20090822.

Specify your MCU in Makefile (Atmega8/Atmega88) and define LED in moo-cdc.h
before building.

System driver considerations can be found at http://www.recursion.jp/avrcdc/.
moo-cdc should be compatible with any driver mentioned there although some
solutions will prevent it from running with high speeds. 115200 baud works
with Linux and the inf-only driver for Windows XP.

Have fun!
